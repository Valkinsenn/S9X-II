                                        <h4>Command Staff</h4>
                                        <p>Command Staff is comprised of the Commander and Executive Officer. Together they are responsible for planning new team initiatives, maintaining Squad 9’s organization and finances, assigning roles and responsibility to members, and positively developing the team as a whole. Command Staff may issue clarification or settle disputes involving operational directives, team policies, Protocols, or any issues requiring high-level rulings.
                                        The Executive Officer has the ability to discharge the duties of the Commander if that individual becomes indisposed. The Commander can only be removed by impeachment—for exhibiting patterns of irresponsible behavior that violate the Code of Conduct—or through resignation. A resigning Commander may nominate a replacement, to be approved by Command Staff. In all other circumstances, authority passes to the Executive Officer until Officer Corps elects a new Commander by unanimous vote.</p>
                                        <h4>Officer Corps</h4>
                                        <p>Officer Corps is comprised of members who are active in leading and executing online operations. Every Officer shall be assigned charge over a part of Squad 9’s operations or organization, as determined by Command Staff.  Officer Corps operates under the oversight of Command Staff and is permitted to accomplish its goals by any means, so long as those means do not defy Squad 9 Team Protocols or the Code of Conduct. Additional responsibilities shared by Officer Corps include team administration and event planning, along with processing recruits, training members, server administration, moderation roles, issuing award nominations, and coordinating member activities.</p>
                                        <h4>Support Roles</h4>
                                        <p>Members may participate in non-leadership (Officer Corps, Command Staff) functions that support Squad 9’s continued operation.  These Support Roles include Moderators, Fireteam Leaders, and other similar positions that do not involve a management capacity.  Qualifications and eligibility for Support Roles shall be established by Officer Corps or Command Staff and modified as needed.</p>
                                        <h4>Members</h4>
                                        <p>Members carry out directives established by Command Staff or Officer Corps. Every member participates in Squad 9 operations and represents the face of the team online. They are allowed the use of Squad 9’s website, servers, and communications platforms. Members may organize into Fireteams if they so choose, and are free to invite new people to join the Squad. All recruits must be processed by a member of Officer Corps.</p>

                                        <p>Areas essential to Squad 9’s administration are outlined as follows:</p>
                                        <h4>Admin Policies</h4>
                                        <p>Administrative access to Squad 9’s online domains is limited to Command Staff or authorized members of Officer Corps.  Other members may be granted provisional access. Passwords may only be changed by Command Staff.  Access control to all Squad 9 systems is subject to Command Staff and Officer Corps’ joint management.</p>
                                        <h4>Team Servers</h4>
                                        <p>Command Staff and Officer Corps are responsible for regulating activities on team-sponsored servers or voice communication platforms. Non-members may have their access to team servers and systems restricted as appropriate.  The Code of Conduct will be enforced at all times and anyone found to be violating its terms is subject to suspension or ban.</p>
                                        <h4>Alliances</h4>
                                        <p>Terms and conditions of any alliances formed with other groups are left to the discretion of Command Staff.  Alliances may not be dissolved without a unanimous ruling by Command Staff.</p>
                                        <h4>Code of Conduct</h4>
                                        <p>The Code of Conduct is the exclusive property of Squad 9’s members. It represents our core document and may not be modified or amended without unanimous approval by Command Staff and Officer Corps.  Review of the Code should occur annually, and any modifications or amendments require full consensus by leadership to be ratified.</p>
                                        <h4>Team Protocols</h4>
                                        <p class="mb-5">All Protocols established for various institutions or functions within Squad 9 are considered official policy and may accompany the Code of Conduct, but do not supersede it.  Protocols may be drafted or modified as needed by Officer Corps or Command Staff and require a simple majority of approvals by both branches of leadership to be implemented or amended.</p>

                                    <p>In addition to the PO, other members of Officer Corps or Command Staff can take part in facilitating the probation process, as having interactions with multiple members of leadership helps the recruit to integrate better. The main objective is to ensure they will be a good fit for Squad 9.</p>
                                    <p>Officer Corps is responsible for tracking a new recruit’s progress during their probation. If a recruit fails to earn promotion or commits an infraction, they will be ejected and have to restart their recruitment from the beginning.  Any recruits found to be hacking will be Blacklisted and issued a permanent ban from the team.</p>
                                    <p>Any recruit who is ejected more than twice for reasons other than hacking will be permanently banned.  Once a recruit earns their first promotion, they complete probation and are issued normal ~S9~ tags. </p>

                                <p>Fireteams have been an integral part of Squad 9 since its formation. Smaller, focused groups of players working together can achieve more by coordinating operations and training, as well as competing against other Fireteams. Members may join Fireteams to specialize their skills or activity, or to focus on specific games played by the Squad.</p>
